  <h2>Notes on Time & Memory optimization with Python</h2>

  <p>In my Fanfic project I had to work with text data that adds up to ~36G (in CSV format). The server I use has 200G RAM, which seems big, but is actually not much when you manipulate data with this size. So, after repeatingly waiting for 3 days and getting a memory error, I realized I have to work on optimizing my code, which I had little training on. Therefore I’ll put my notes on how to do it here, along with some take aways that I learned by the hard way.</p>

<p>I’m using Python and specifically the Pandas library to handle my data, so the notes will focus on how to save time/memory with them.</p>

<h2 id="finding-the-bottle-necks">Finding the bottle necks</h2>
<p>Instead of randomly shooting, a smarter way is to first figure out which part of the code caused the slowliness/bulkiness. That is, we need a profile of the time/memory consumption for each part, ideally each line, of the code.</p>

<p>For time profiling, Python comes with very good libraries <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/profile.html">cProfile and Profile</a>. cProfile is faster, so I went with it.</p>

<p>It is easy to use the library:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">python -m cProfile -s cumtime unigram_turing_opt.py</code></p>

<p>This is a screenshot of the output:</p>

<p><img src="../public/images/2017-03-25-time" alt="image" /></p>

<p>There are a few columns; <code class="highlighter-rouge">s</code> specifies which column to sort by. Here I sort by <code class="highlighter-rouge">cumtime</code>, so the code taking the most cumulative time is shown at the top. It is also easier to redirect the output to a file and <code class="highlighter-rouge">head</code> the file.</p>

<p>cProfile can also be used to time a single function. There is no need for me to describe the usage here.</p>

<p>We can also use external libraries. Robert Kern has a <a href="https://github.com/rkern/line_profiler">line_profiler</a> that allows line-to-line profiling. cProfile seems enough for me so I didn’t really use it. It’s well documented, so no more notes is needed here too.</p>

<p>For memory profiling, I used a library <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/memory_profiler">memory_profler</a> that is similar to the line_profiler. It can also profile the entire script or just one function. To profile my main() function, I can put a decorator before it:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>from memory_profiler import profile

@profile
def main(fandom):
	print('working on fandom: ', fandom)
	df = pd.read_csv(fandom + '_preprocessed.tsv', sep = '\t')
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The output:</p>

<p><img src="../public/images/2017-03-25-memory" alt="image" /></p>

<p>I also read a nice blog post <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/tutorials/how-to-profile-memory-usage-in-python">How to profile memory usage in Python</a> that explains how to use the library in details.</p>

<h2 id="time-optimizing-notes">Time optimizing notes</h2>
<p>By doing the profiling described above and analyzing the reports, I was able to shorten the runtime of my code from 3 days to ~1.5 hours. Here are some main take aways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>NLTK’s stemming is really slow. Stay away from it.</li>
  <li>When working with Pandas dataframes, take out the unused columns ASAP.</li>
  <li>Pandas’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">apply</code> can be slow if you do it row by row (<code class="highlighter-rouge">axis=1</code>). <code class="highlighter-rouge">map</code> can be better, because <code class="highlighter-rouge">map</code> operates on the series and <code class="highlighter-rouge">apply</code> on the dataframe.</li>
</ol>

<p>I haven’t totally sorted out my memory error, so will add this later.</p>
